# 3D-Maze-Generator
A 3D maze generator in Unity.

<h2>Controls</h2>
WASD for movement and mouse for looking around. Space and Left control are for up and down respectively.

<h2>Settings</h2>
The "number of loops" setting controls how many cell walls are destroyed in the maze. These effectively create loops since a missing wall in a maze makes a loop.

<h2>Building</h2>
Install the unity version specified in the unity hub for this project and press play in the editor.
